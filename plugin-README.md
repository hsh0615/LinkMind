2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The plugin has minimal configuration. Simply install and enable it to start using.

Future versions may include additional configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

- If notes are not being created, check that the plugin is enabled
- If AI content is not being generated, ensure the Python script is running in monitoring mode
- For issues with the Python script, check the console output for error messages
